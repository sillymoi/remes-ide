<h1>Uppaal Properties</h1>
<h2>Reachability Properties.</h2> 
<p>They ask whether a given state formula,&Phi;, possibly can be satisfied
by any reachable state. Another way of stating this is: <i>Does there exist a path
starting at the initial state, such that &Phi; is eventually satisfied along that path?</i>
<p>Reachability properties are often used while designing a model to perform
sanity checks. For instance, when creating a model of a communication protocol
involving a sender and a receiver, it makes sense to ask whether it is possible
for the sender to send a message at all or whether a message can possibly be
received.
<p>These properties do not by themselves guarantee the correctness of the
model (e.g., that any message is eventually delivered in a communication protocol), but they validate the
basic behavior of the model. In UPPAAL, we write this property using the syntax 'E<>&Phi;'.

<h2>Safety Properties.</h2> 
<p>Safety properties are of the form: </i>"something bad will never
happen".</i>
<p>For instance, in a model of a nuclear power plant, a safety property
might be, that the operating temperature is always (invariantly) under a certain
threshold, or that a meltdown never occurs.
<p>A variation of this property is that <i>"something will possibly never happen".</i>
<p>For instance when playing a game, a safe state is one in which we can still win the game, hence we will possibly not
loose.
<p>In UPPAAL these properties are formulated positively, e.g., something good
is invariantly true. In UPPAAL, we express that &Phi; should be true
in all reachable states with the path formulae 'A[]&Phi;', whereas 'E[]&Phi;'
says that there should exist a maximal path such that &Phi; is always true.
